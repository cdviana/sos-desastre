# SOS Desastre
Prototype of a mobile app developed with MIT App Inventor 2 during a UNIVESP project (2018/1) as part of a Computer Engineering undergraduate course.

The main goal was to develop an app that would allow users to record the occurrence of disasters - such as landlides, floods and fire - creating a permanent real-time database that would communicate with other users (focusing on residents of the same region) and responsible authorities.
